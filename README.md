## Sketchy
Have you ever wanted to test if the new sofa will have enough place in the living room? Well, Sketchy is here to help you!<br />
Create, grab, scale, rotate, move, whatever! You can also share the room so that your best friend can approve the new arrangement

Well, some use this to create whatever they want so, you can do that too! Just look at the gif, not a room at all from my point of view

You can find a live version of Sketchy [here](https://playkloud.com/yinch/webxr/sketch02/)!
